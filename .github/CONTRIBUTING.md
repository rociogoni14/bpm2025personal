# Contributing to DjangoCon US 2021

:thumbsup: :tada: Thank you so much for taking the time to contribute! :tada: :thumbsup:

The following is a set of guidelines for contributing to DjangoCon US 2021.


## How Can I Help?

Start looking through the [Issues](https://github.com/djangocon/2021.djangocon.us/issues) and watch out for any issues with the yellow label [`up-for-grabs`](https://github.com/djangocon/2021.djangocon.us/labels/up-for-grabs). Issues marked with this label haven't been assigned to anyone yet and we would love for you to work on them.


## Difficulty Levels

Here's a quick guide to help you understand what the different difficulty labels mean that you will find while looking through the issues:

[`difficulty: easy`](https://github.com/djangocon/2021.djangocon.us/labels/difficulty%3A%20easy): Fixing this issue doesn't require a lot of time or programming knowledge. This would be a great issue for someone new to programming or open source to work on.
[`difficulty: medium`](https://github.com/djangocon/2021.djangocon.us/labels/difficulty%3A%20medium): This is an issue which requires more time or programming knowledge than a `difficulty: easy` issue but you don't have to be a programming expert to fix it.
[`difficulty: hard`](https://github.com/djangocon/2021.djangocon.us/labels/difficulty%3A%20hard): This issue probably requires some time or a good bit of programming knowledge and could be a challenge, but this shouldn't keep you from trying to submit a patch for it :wink:

## Reporting bugs

If you find any bugs, it would be great if you would let us know so we can look into it. You can do so by creating an issue. If you don't know how to create an issue, please follow [these instructions](https://help.github.com/articles/creating-an-issue/). Screenshots and notes for how you encountered the bug are really helpful when reporting bugs!
