In this talk we will discuss: 

* `runserver`, and why it should not be run in production
* what options are out there for deploying your Django application, and why managed platforms are useful
* database options, and why PostgreSQL is the best choice
* introductory system administration for Django developers

among more base concepts on the wonderful world of deployments!

Attendees will come away with a more complete understanding as to why deployments are complex, and clarity on why some time-honoured suggestions really are the best decisions to get on with the rest of your day.
