As Software as a Service continues to grow in todayâ€™s landscape, many applications must adapt and provide services to multiple clients. Multitenancy has proven to be a mature architecture that can achieve secure data segregation while sustaining application functionality for multiple clients with lower costs. We have looked for pre-existing solutions to implement multitenancy, but were unable to find one. In this talk, we will demonstrate the benefits of multitenancy and provide a simple way to implement a lightweight, single-database, single-schema, multi-tenant architecture in virtually any Django application by using Django Guardian.
