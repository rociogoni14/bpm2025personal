abstract: 'Python''s shiny frameworks drive some people to spend too little time learning
  the basics, which makes it harder in the long run to develop successful applications.

  Join me for the hypothetical learning journey of a Pythonista as we refactor a function
  and learn powerful vanilla Python features.'

- bio: "[Rodrigo](https://linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-girão-serrão) has always been fascinated
    by problem solving and that is why he picked up programming – so that he could
    solve more problems.\r\nHe also loves sharing knowledge, and that is why he spends
    so much time writing articles @ [mathspp.com](https://mathspp.com) and giving
    workshops and courses.\r\n\r\nHis main areas of scientific interest are mathematics
    (numerical analysis in particular) and programming in general (with a preference
    for the Python and APL languages), but Rodrigo also enjoys reading fantasy books,
    watching silly comedy movies and eating chocolate."

title: Pydon'ts – Write elegant Python code (v1.1)
video_url: https://youtu.be/s6dJab2qwkg
---

In this talk I show what idiomatic Python code looks like and illustrate how the subjective notion of "beautiful", or "elegant" code, can make your code objectively better, regardless of your Python skill level.

We do that by visiting several vanilla Python features that people sometimes forget to learn, as they rush to `import`ing all the shiny modules and frameworks they really want to use.

In order to achieve this, we go through the learning journey of a hypothetical Pythonista, taking a function written by them and refactoring it incrementally through the use of Pythonic idioms and patterns.

The whole talk will build around a weekly series of articles I have been publishing, where I explore all the vanilla Python features that make Python one of the most interesting programming languages to learn.
