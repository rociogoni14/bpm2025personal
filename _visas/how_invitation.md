  For registered participants and authors of accepted papers, we can provide an invitation letter for visas. Please mark “I need an invitation letter for visa” during the registration process. We will then get in touch with you. We will need these pieces of information:

    - Name (as it appears on your passport) and mailing address
    - Your passport ID and date of birth
    - Your registration confirmation number
    - The title of your accepted paper (if applicable)
    - EasyChair ID (if applicable, if you submitted to a workshop also the workshop name)
    - A fax number or an email address to where we can send the letter

  Please note that it can take up to two weeks to receive the invitation letter.
