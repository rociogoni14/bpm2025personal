        DjangoCon US will be providing two platforms for live chat during the conference
        </h2>

        <p class="lead">
        We'll use <a href="https://discord.com/">Discord</a> and <a href="https://spatial.chat/">SpatialChat</a> for live chat.
        <br>
        If you picked up a ticket when they were available (we had to close early due to capacity issues), please check your inbox for the links. The link to Discord went out on Thursday, October 21, and the SpatialChat link will go out on Friday, October 22.
        <br>
        Capacity in SpatialChat is limited, so if you can't sign in, keep hanging out in the Discord.
