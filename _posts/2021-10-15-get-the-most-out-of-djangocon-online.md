##### Conference Theater
Watch content with your conference pals! At the bottom of your screen there is a toolbar. On the far left, there is a plus sign with a teal circle. Clicking it will expand a menu with multi-media sharing options. Click "Add Video." An input bar will then prompt you to add the link to a YouTube, Twitch or Vimeo video. We recommend resizing the frame to fit the screen.

> Note: By default, new videos can only be heard if a user moves close to the video element. In order to enable full room sharing, **recommended only in presentation spaces like the Conference Theater**, engage with the video element by clicking. A toolbar above the video will appear. On the far left of the toolbar will be an icon with sliders for adjusting the settings. Toggle the button "Room-wide sound" to enable and "Sync video playback for all viewers" if not already enabled. We recommend a starting volume of 25%.

##### Workshop Room
Have a tutorial you're jumping to give? Interested in sharing a demo? Hop into the workshop room and give your insight to an audience. No need to reserve the room; it's first come, first served. Just put your topic up on the virtual chalk board, and an attendee can call "dibs" for next topic by adding it to the bottom of the board.
