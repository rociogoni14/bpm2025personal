title: Announcing the 2021 DjangoCon US Talks
---

We're proud to announce the talks for this year's online DjangoCon US.

The Django community and beyond submitted an incredible number of talk
proposals, and selecting these talks was extremely difficult for our program
team. We appreciate the effort everyone put into their submissions; thank you!
Another huge thank you to our reviewers, without whom this list would still be
weeks in the making.

We will announce the full conference schedule soon. If you haven't picked up
your ticket yet, they're still [available](https://ti.to/defna/djangocon-us-2021).
