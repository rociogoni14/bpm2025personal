Hi! I'm Aldán Creo, a CS student with a **huge** passion for computers! I love to contribute to open source, because it makes me feel like I have a meaningful impact on the community. That's why I signed up for *Google Summer of Code*, a global program designed to allow students to work on open source projects in established organizations. I chose Django –which is affiliated with the Wagtail CMS– to develop an exciting project of creating a new search backend for Wagtail. It's been an incredibly rewarding experience, and that's why I'd love to show everyone how great it was to collaborate on Wagtail to code a project **that is used by millions of people each day**. Would you like to know more? I'll be glad to tell you all about it!
