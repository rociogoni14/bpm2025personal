I am a software engineer based in London. I mostly do backend engineering for web based applications. Python and Django are what I have been mostly working with since 2008.

Currently I am leading the engineering team in CogX (formerly CognitionX), a London based startup, specialises on aggregating leadership content.

I am co-organiser of London Django Meetup, Pycon Turkey, DjangoGirls Turkey, and a proud member of PSF and DSF.
