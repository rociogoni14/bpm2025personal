Madelaine is currently at bit.io building an immediately productive, shareable cloud database. Previously, she built and led a team to improve the end-to-end containerization, deployment, and orchestration of Facebook’s private cloud, and built both software and firmware for ML-powered hearing aids. She’s worked on everything from mobile infrastructure and compilers, to front-end product, even Windows Desktop software. However, Madelaine's technical accomplishment of which she is most proud was when she changed her job title to zalgo text and broke Facebook HR's data pipelines. She once won a rap battle by rhyming with "vim."
