Over the past 12 years, having fought his way out of the caves of CMS building, through the salt mines of PHP, and over the poppy fields of Ruby, Tyrel now lives happily in the golden city of Python where he builds Django and Flask web apps. He sometimes vacations in Go-ville, and makes the mandatory trip or two each year to visit his in-laws in Javascriptburgâ€™s pour-over district.
