I am a Python enthusiast with a focus on the web backend and automation. Despite my youth I have worked in several different mostly non-tech positions before switching to software engineering full-time due to needing more daily technical challenges. I did not really consider this a career change though, as code for me is merely a language through which to express ideas and a tool with which to build systems. Python allows me to build systems that are intricate as well as approachable and develop my ideas in a way that makes them useful to other people and hopefully society. To me software architecture really is the highest form of creativity. I am passionate about open source and am an organiser, speaker and diversity advocate in my local Slovenian Python community.
