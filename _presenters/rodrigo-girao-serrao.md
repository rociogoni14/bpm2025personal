[Rodrigo](https://linkedin.com/in/rodrigo-girão-serrão) has always been fascinated by problem solving and that is why he picked up programming – so that he could solve more problems.
He also loves sharing knowledge, and that is why he spends so much time writing articles @ [mathspp.com](https://mathspp.com) and giving workshops and courses.

His main areas of scientific interest are mathematics (numerical analysis in particular) and programming in general (with a preference for the Python and APL languages), but Rodrigo also enjoys reading fantasy books, watching silly comedy movies and eating chocolate.
