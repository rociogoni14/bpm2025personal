I am a Python developer, working in the Education team in City Network. I still consider myself new in this industry as I changed my career in late 2018, working in a medical lab before getting into coding. I am a former Outreachy intern and a FOSS enthusiast. 
Being self-taught myself, I love being a part of providing online learning resources for others. 
Our learning platform (mentioned in the talk) is the [City Cloud Academy](https://academy.citycloud.com).
