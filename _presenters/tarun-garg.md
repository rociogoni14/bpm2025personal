I'm currently working as Engineering Manager at SquadStack, I've been here since 5 years and have seen the team and processes grow from 3 member engineering team to a now ~50 people engineering team. Being the early member of the engineering team, I got to experience a fair share of challenges and make a lot of mistakes along the way and that's why I wanted to share those learnings so that other people don't make those same mistakes and the community keeps on growing :D.

More about me? I've recently made a step into management and till now(6 months in) i'm liking it; make no mistake it is stressful but rewarding also(in it's own way). I love solving people, process & product challenges. When not working I can found reading books, or playing some strategic games like Catan or [Chess](https://www.chess.com/member/tarungarg546).
