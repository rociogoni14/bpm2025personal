Wil has a love for building things and especially for building things with Django. He has been using Django for the past seven years to build Simple Poll, one of the most popular apps for Slack. More recently he has been working on Kolo, a tool to show you what your Django code is actually doing as it's running to help any Django user understand much more quickly what's going on and where potential problems might exist.
