Katie has worn many different hats over the years. She has been a software developer for many languages, systems administrator for multiple operating systems, and speaker on many different topics.

She is a Senior Engineer at Google Cloud, and has previously served as a Director for both the Django and Python software foundations.

When she's not changing the world, she enjoys making tapestries, cooking, and seeing just how well various application stacks handle emoji.
