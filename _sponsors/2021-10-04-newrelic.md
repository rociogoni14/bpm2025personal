  New Relic :heart:s Django, and we are so happy to be able to support such a wonderful community! We're big fans of Django internally, our Python APM (Application Performance Monitoring) Agent ships with Django (and DRF!) support baked in. No convoluted setup, just pip install. Also don't miss out on the streams by Aaron Bassett (Django Software Foundation Vice President and Relican) for plenty of Django and GraphQL live coding. You can catch him on Twitch at [@aaronbassettdev](https://www.twitch.tv/aaronbassettdev) or on the [@new_relic](https://www.twitch.tv/new_relic) channel! You can also visit [trynewrelic.com/djangocon](https://trynewrelic.com/djangocon) to find out more.
