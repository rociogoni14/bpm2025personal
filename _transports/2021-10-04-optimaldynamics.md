  Optimal Dynamics introduces next-generation artificial intelligence to enable logistics companies to better plan, optimize and automate strategic, tactical and real-time operational decisions. <br/> <br/> Based on nearly 40 years of extensive research & development at Princeton University in conjunction with decades of real-world application, CORE.ai reimagines how private fleets, dedicated capacity and for-hire carriers think about planning and operating their truckload assets, drivers and brokerage arms where applicable. Our platform enables users to ask hyper-detailed strategic "what if" questions via a simulation-based environment. We then leverage those outputs to maximize network profitability, increase asset revenue/utilization, reduce unnecessary cost and mitigate risk, all while keeping drivers moving in the most efficient manner.
